# Project-AI-Agent

## Abstract
In the era of data-driven decision-making and information overload, the need for automated research and analysis agents is paramount. This project presents the design and implementation of a Research Assistant Agent using Python, leveraging the OpenAI API (ChatGPT) for advanced reasoning, and integrating custom logic for data analysis, summarization, information retrieval, and language translation.

The agent operates in a loop mimicking a human research workflow—planning, searching, analyzing, and synthesizing answers—using a sequence of reasoned thoughts and [action, observation] cycles. Key capabilities include web search simulation, text summarization, basic statistics computation, and multilingual translation. The system architecture is modular and scalable, allowing future integration of live web search APIs, file I/O, and advanced NLP tools.

This solution demonstrates the practical use of large language models as research copilots and workflow orchestrators, with applications in education, business analysis, and intelligent information retrieval.

## Program
1. Environment & Libraries
Python 3.11+

OpenAI API (for LLM reasoning)

Python standard libraries (re, statistics, etc.)

Optional: dotenv for API key management

2. Agent Architecture
a. Agent Class
A lightweight class that maintains a prompt history and interacts with the OpenAI API. It supports:

Initializing with a system prompt

Handling user queries

Managing a conversation-style turn-based context

b. Research Prompt
Defines the agent’s operating rules:

Emulates a scientific research workflow: Thought → Action → PAUSE → Observation → repeat until Answer.

Recognizes the following actions:

web_search: Simulates web-based information gathering

summarize_text: Summarizes long text

calculate_stats: Computes mean, median, and standard deviation on number lists

translate_text: Translates phrases between languages

c. Research Actions
Python functions to simulate/implement the agent’s allowed actions:

Simulated search (static dictionary lookup based on keywords)

Simple rule/statistics-based text summarization

Statistical analysis using the statistics library

Rule-based multilingual phrase translation

d. Main Research Loop
A loop calling the agent with a question, parsing the LLM’s suggested action (using regular expressions), executing the action, feeding back the result as a new observation, and iterating until the agent generates a final answer.

e. Test Cases
Sample scenarios show the agent’s behavior in answering research, data analysis, and language translation queries.
